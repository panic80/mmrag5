# Test Document for RAG System

## Introduction
This is a test document to evaluate the PDF ingestion pipeline in our RAG system.
The system should be able to process this document, extract its content, and generate embeddings.

## Key Features
- PDF content extraction
- Text chunking
- Metadata enrichment
- Embedding generation
- Vector storage

## Technical Details
The RAG system uses advanced algorithms to process documents effectively.
It employs OpenAI's embedding models to create vector representations of text chunks.
These embeddings are then stored in a Qdrant vector database for efficient retrieval.

## Conclusion
This test document should help verify that the PDF ingestion pipeline works correctly.
If successful, we'll see this content properly chunked and embedded in the system.

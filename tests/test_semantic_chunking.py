Chapter 1: Introduction

This is a long text that spans multiple paragraphs and contains various types of content.
It will help us test the semantic chunking algorithm's ability to handle diverse content.

Section 1.1: Background

The background section contains important context information.
This should ideally be kept together in a single chunk when possible.
- Point 1: This is an important point
- Point 2: This is another important point
- Point 3: Yet another bullet point to test list handling

Section 1.2: Technical Details

This section contains code samples and technical details.
```python
def example_function():
    # This is a code block
    for i in range(10):
        print(f"Processing item {i}")
    return "Done"
```

The code above demonstrates a simple function that processes items.

Chapter 2: Methodology

This chapter describes the methodology used in the research.
It contains several sections with different types of content.

Section 2.1: Data Collection

The data was collected through various means including:
1. Surveys
2. Interviews
3. Observations

Section 2.2: Analysis

The analysis used statistical methods to derive insights.
| Method    | Purpose           | Accuracy |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| Method 1  | Classification    | 85%      |
| Method 2  | Regression        | 92%      |
| Method 3  | Clustering        | 78%      |

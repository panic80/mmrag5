# RAG Ingestion Pipeline - Embedding API Optimization

## Overview

This document summarizes the improvements made to optimize the embedding API calls in the RAG ingestion pipeline.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Token-Aware Batching
- Added intelligent batching system based on estimated token counts
- Implemented dynamic batch size adjustment to avoid exceeding API limits
- Added batch size optimization to maximize throughput while maintaining API compliance

### 2. Enhanced Retry Logic
- Implemented multi-layered retry mechanism:
  - Decorator-based using tenacity with exponential backoff 
  - Manual retry handling for greater control and testing
- Added retry count tracking and performance monitoring
- Implemented gradual timeout increases for transient issues

### 3. Error Categorization & Handling
- Created specialized error classes at module level:
  - `RateLimitError` for rate limiting issues
  - `AuthenticationError` for API key problems
  - `ServiceUnavailableError` for temporary service disruptions
- Added error categorization function to properly identify and handle different API errors
- Implemented strategic handling based on error type:
  - Additional delays for rate limit errors
  - Fast failures for authentication issues
  - Gradual backoff for service availability problems

### 4. Performance Monitoring
- Added comprehensive metrics tracking:
  - Request success/failure counts
  - Retry statistics
  - Token usage tracking
  - Processing time measurements
  - Batch size distribution
- Implemented detailed logging for:
  - API errors with context
  - Performance statistics (tokens/second, texts/second)
  - Request latency tracking
  - Batch processing efficiency

### 5. API Version Compatibility
- Enhanced detection of OpenAI client versions for both v0.x and v1.x APIs
- Implemented consistent interface regardless of client version
- Added defensive code to handle differences in response formats

## Performance Impact

These optimizations should result in:
- Reduced API costs through more efficient token usage and batching
- Improved throughput with parallel processing and optimized batch sizes
- Enhanced reliability through robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- Better observability with detailed metrics and logs
- Greater resilience to transient API issues and rate limits

## Next Steps

- Consider implementing token caching to avoid re-embedding identical content
- Explore adaptive rate limiting based on API response headers
- Add circuit breaker pattern for catastrophic failure scenarios
- Implement detailed cost tracking based on actual token usage
